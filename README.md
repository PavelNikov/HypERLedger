# HypERLedger
A proof of concept cryptocurrency written in Erlang.

# Usage
Typing the following commands will compile everything that needs to be compiled, enter the erlang shell and run the test program. This will start the Central Authority and open a client application. From there on, the program should be fairly self-explanatory

`erl -make`
`erl`
`test:start()`
