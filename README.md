# HypERLedger
A proof of concept cryptocurrency written in Erlang.

**Discalimer:** This has nothing to do with [this Hyperledger](https://www.hyperledger.org/) or [this one](https://www.ibm.com/blockchain/hyperledger) project. It's just a blockchain written in erlang and hyperledger is a blockchain-related-word containing the letters ERL which are short for Erlang. #PunIntended #ProbablyLessFunnyThanWeThought 

# Usage
Typing the following commands will compile everything that needs to be compiled, enter the erlang shell and run the test program. This will start the Central Authority and open a client application. From there on, the program should be fairly self-explanatory

```bash
> erl -make
> erl
> test:start().
```
